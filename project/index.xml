      <title>Adaptive Experimental Design using Bayesian Optimisation</title>

      <description>This project aims to optimise processes for manufacturing new materials, from short fibres, to alloys, to cosmetics, to food, or, in fact, any material for industry or consumer use. By using machine learning and Bayesian mathematics (a sophisticated form of probability), we have developed an abstract framework and software that achieves a faster, cheaper and more effective approach to optimising products and manufacturing processes.
The computational challenge in optimisation of novel processes arises because the mathematical relationship between the control variables and the target is often unknown - it is a classic “Black-Box Function”.</description>

      <title>Early Intervention for Autism</title>

      <description>There is a growing gap between the number of children with autism requiring early intervention and available therapy. In this project we seek to produce the following outcomes: * Flexible frameworks for stimulus presentation and recording, for early intervention in social and cognitive/visual areas, * Open source infrastructures to leverage content and metadata from social media, constructing foundations for reusable content in early intervention, * Assistive Technologies for finding appropriate information from forums and blogs, focusing on autism, * Early warning systems of mental wellbeing, measuring affect in text-based social media (forums, blogs, etc.</description>

      <title>Health Analytics</title>

      <description>With our partner Barwon Health we are embarking on questions that arise in examination of large, disparate and multimodal hospital data sets. Can we impact and inform the formation of dynamic health intervention and improved safety and care through:
 Predicting hospital visitation patterns of patients with chronic disease, Detection of sub-populations that have coherent patterns of disease, causal factors, and typical medical responses Identify data driven characteristics of chronic patients to enable personalized care plans Detect indicators that serve as early warning of chronic disease Monitor key factors that deliver value to patients in the areas of care experiences, care coordination and patient safety.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Surveillance</title>

      <description>We are interested in the problems that arise when we examine hundreds of cameras. This big data problem opens up many new questions: Given limited operator capacity, how can select which camera I should look at? How do I select models and parameters for heterogeneous stream data - example, video feeds in varying environmental conditions? How do I evaluate algorithms in big data - training sets may exceeds 2 weeks of video data, and no realistic ground truth can be obtained from operators.</description>

      <title>Social Media Analysis</title>

      <description>We study patterns in social media data; who is talking to who? What are they talking about? What is their sentiment? We discover latent community structures, their topics and trends. We explore not only text in blogs but also connectivity through comments. For personal media management it could be argued that social context contains the set of conceptions most often brought to bear on their contents: Where was this? Who is that?</description>
